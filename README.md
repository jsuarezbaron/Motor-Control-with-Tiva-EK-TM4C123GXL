legged robot applications
The purpose of this application is to control, effectively and reliably, the Position (angle) of a brushed DC motor with a real time PD Controller.  
We are going to need several parts in order to program (in C language and CCS software provided by Texas Instruments fot TI launchpads) and
test the controller including:
•	Board with QEI module
•	DC motor
•	Motor driver
•	Several multicolor wires
•	RS-232 to USB cable
•	Incremental rotary encoder
•	24 Volts Power Supply
•	Breadboard
